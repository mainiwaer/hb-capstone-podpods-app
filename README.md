# PodPods: A Social Podcast Review Website ![logo]

PodPods is a social podcast review app powered by the ListenNotes podcast API. A user can search for podcasts by name, see random recommendations, and look at popular podcasts by genre. The user can go to a podcast's page to see further details like episode counts, language, and a link to the podcast's homepage. The user can also listen to recent episodes within the app, and see reviews by other PodPods users.

After signing in, a user can also leave their own review or add the podcast to one of their collections. Users can search for other users and see their profiles, including their reviews, podcast collections, and bios. Adding a user to the friends list will populate their username on your own profile under "Your Pod Squad".
